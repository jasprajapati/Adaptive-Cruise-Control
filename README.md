Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) Project Overview
This project involves designing and simulating an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system in MATLAB. The ACC system is a driver assistance feature that adjusts a vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. It combines sensor-based detection, a PID control algorithm, and a vehicle dynamics model to dynamically manage throttle and braking.

The project simulates real-world driving scenarios, such as constant-speed following, sudden braking, and stop-and-go traffic, to evaluate system performance and ensure safety and comfort.
